# python-njmv-appoinment
Python Script for generating alerts when appointment is available for NJ MVC



If you want to search for appointment only on specific locations say Lawrenceville and Camden, then update the location_arr and locationname_arr variables location_arr = ['51','54'] locationname_arr = ['Eatontown','Freehold']

if you want to be notified only when appt is available on specific month, for example only on "April" then update the required moths variable accordingly. required_months = ['Nov','November','Oct','October']
